# 📊 Optimizing Sales Management with Power BI

This repository contains the Power BI dashboards and supporting documentation from my **Bachelor Thesis** at TH Köln:  
**"Optimizing Sales Management with Power BI – A Case Study on Contoso."**

## 📌 About the Project

In a data-driven business world, effective sales management is crucial. This project demonstrates how Power BI can be used to:

- Visualize complex sales data interactively
- Enhance decision-making with real-time dashboards
- Improve sales performance and strategic planning
- Leverage user experience (UI/UX) design to improve stakeholder engagement

The case study is based on **Contoso**, a fictional multinational company used widely in Microsoft demos.
